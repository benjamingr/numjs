This is a bad idea. Which language/tool are you going to use to check to make sure your implementation is correct?
Well you should just stick to that language/tool that is used to calibrate the benchmark standard. Making every great library run in JS is a trivial pursuit. Put your talents and energy into extending the features of Numpy and Scipy and not just clone them.     "
