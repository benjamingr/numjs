NumJS project design document
-----------------------------------------


###Overview

The NumJS project will enable fast numeric and scientific calculations easily in JavaScript. This project will allow you to use everything you're used to from SciPy and NumPy in JS natively. Moreover this project will include future hooks for parallel algorithms using Apache Spark.

###Goals

The goal of this project is to port the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) number manipulation library to the JavaScript programming language. Additionally, we intend to port the whole [SciPy stack](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). 

###Core Team

- Team Superviser - [Ohad Asulin](https://github.com/mrohad)
- Team Lead - [Benjamin Gruenbaum](https://github.com/benjamingr)
- Developer - [Stas Groisman](https://github.com/RunningWithScissors)
- Developer - [Gal Zohar](https://github.com/galzo)
- Developer - University Student TBD

###Time Line

There will be weekly team meeting held, in addition either a bi-weekly or monthly meeting between the team and the supervisor. It would be nice to have lectures on performance in addition to the design agenda in meetings - we'll see if that works out.  

Dec 21st 2014 - Begin formal interview process, interview developers who use numpy both in academia and in the industry - collect user stories and requirements.

Dec 31st 2014 - End formal interview process. Finish team assembly.

Jan 1st 2015 - Begin work on sample implementation of numpy;

Jan 20th 2015 - Mock (and likely slow) numjs implementation giving similar to numpy vectors and matrices. 

Jan 20th 2015 - Start work on porting SciPy parts to JavaScript by developers (SciJS) - different parts by different developers

Jan 20th 2015 - Write unit tests and performance benchmarks for the mock implementation, start to gradually improve it and swap the parts out.

Feb 30th 2015 - Reach 40% of numpy speed in numjs using native JavaScript, consider between the alternatives of writing the code in C++ as a node native extension and writing it in vanilla JS utilizing the JIT heavily. 

Mar 20th 2015 - Full working alpha version of NumJS, benchmark using SciJS algorithms. 

April 20th 2015 - team review, problems changes etc.

May 30th 2015 - First public release - v0.2.

June 30th 2015 - Spark and E3 integration

###Challenges

Writing fast JavaScript. 
Implementing complex algorithms that will match and hopefully supercede the performance of numpy.
Implementing algorithms in a parallel ready way.
Design process.
Getting community involvement and traction.
