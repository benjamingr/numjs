Meeting #3
-----------------------

For each of the following functions, write a faster version of the native function in plain JavaScript. Your JS functions should perform what the native functions do - only faster.

 - [`Function#bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)
 - [`Array#map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
 - [`Array#filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) - may be in place.

Implement a vector type of fixed length `n` that holds int32 numbers, implement a multiplication method (dot), a multiplication by scalar method a toArray and a fromArray method for the type. Write the fastest implementation you can.

Implement a fast and compatible (in 95% of cases) JSON parser that reads a JSON file and returns a JS type corrosponding to the json with the same data - like `JSON.parse`. Note that getting good performance here will be kind of hard since parsing stuff that looks like JSON is basically what the engine's parser does all the time. 

Implement a JSON schema parser that reads a JSON of a certain schema once, for example:

    {
        x: 3,
        y : 5,
        name: "foo",
        friends: [1, 2 ,3]
    }
    
And then parses JSON objects of the same type very fast (given 10 other json objects of the type for instance). Note that getting this to be faster than the native implementation will not be easy since it does this optimization already. Also note that you should not just call `eval(json)` - that _will_ work but it will not be fun :(
